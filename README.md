= Countrybase =

com_countrybase is a Joomla 4 component designed to accompany a tutorial on the Anatomy of an MVC Component. 

It displays a list of countries with some currency exchange rate data. It can be used in its own right, although it would need a plugin to update the exchange rates on a daily basis, or used as a basis for something more elaborate.
